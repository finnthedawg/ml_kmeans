## Dataset 1

A visualization of the data provided:

</p>

On visual inspection there appeared to be three distinct clusters, so a `n_clusters = 3` was chosen to run kmeans. To compare the performance of my module, I also ran kmeans using `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`

On the left is the sklearn module's plot. On the right is the plot generated by the numpy module which I implemented. As we can see, the performance was comparable.

## Dataset 2

This dataset is similar to the dataset used during an earlier regression problem.

After running the Kmeans algorithm with a cluster size of 2, we obtained the following result:

Comparing the result to the first graph, we note that the kmeans algorithm correctly grouped the points even across some feature spaces `x1 x2`, as we would expect, surpassing the performance of linear regression in this case.

## Image compression

Our image was compressed with 32 centroid clusters.

Each pixel in the image was converted from color values to a `label` which was the centroid that described the color. The optimal centroid colors were determined by running the algorithm over the 3 features `r g b`. To generate the compressed image, each pixel was re-assigned the color based upon which centroid it's label described.
